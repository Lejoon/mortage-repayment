# Mortgage Repayment Strategies Simulation

This project simulates two mortgage repayment strategies over a period of 5 years using Monte Carlo methods:

1. **Paying down the mortgage principal** with available monthly cash.
2. **Investing the available monthly cash in stocks** and using the investment portfolio to pay off the mortgage at the end.
